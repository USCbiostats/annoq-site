            <p>
                The Annotation Query (AnnoQ) is an integrated functional annotation platform for large-scale genetic
                variant annotation. The backend of the system is a large collection of pre-annotated variants from the
                Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) (~39 million) with sequence features (by WGSA) and functions
                (PANTHER and Gene Ontology). Currently only human variants are supported. The data is built in an
                Elasticsearch framework and an API was built to
                allow users to quickly access the annotation data, with one of the following three ways (see attached
                figures).
